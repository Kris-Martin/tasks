## Instructions

The app loads with a set of dummy tasks.

-   You can delete tasks using the x button or add using the + button.
-   Tasks are sorted and assigned a colour based on their priority.
-   You can assign the priority of a task using the drop down menu when adding a task.

**Note**: The app does not yet have persistent data storage so on reload the app will reset to the initial dummy tasks.

You can view and interact with the project at:
